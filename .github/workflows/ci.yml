  # Deny warns here as a catch-all and because some commands (e.g. cargo build) don't accept `--deny warnings`
  # but also deny them on all individual cargo invocations where available because:
  # 1) Some commands might not support rustflags (e.g. clippy didn't at first, cargo doc uses a different var, ...)
  # 2) People might copy paste the commands into CI where this flag is missing without noticing.
